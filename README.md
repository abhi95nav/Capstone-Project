"Predic(on of House SalePrice with Advanced Machine Learning Models."


Problem Statement:
Accurately determining house sale prices while considering crucial ameni5es and features
remains a con5nuous challenge in real estate. Tradi5onal methods o9en need to pay more
a:en5on to the intricate interplay of property a:ributes, local factors, and market trends,
resul5ng in misguided decisions and discontent. This project aims to leverage the dataset from
the Kaggle compe55on to address this issue and develop a robust predic5ve model that accounts
for these variables, thereby enhancing the accuracy of house price predic5ons.


There are two datasets, train.csv, and test.csv, with both datasets consis5ng of 1460 observa5ons and
81 a:ributes each.
