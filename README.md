"Predic(on of House SalePrice with Advanced Machine Learning Models."


Problem Statement:
Accurately determining house sale prices while considering crucial amenities and features remains a continuous challenge in real estate. Traditional methods often need to pay more attention to the intricate interplay of property attributes, local factors, and market trends, resulting in misguided decisions and discontent. This project aims to leverage the dataset from the Kaggle competition to address this issue and develop a robust predictive model that accounts for these variables, thereby enhancing the accuracy of house price predictions.

There are two datasets, train.csv, and test.csv, with both datasets consisting of 1460 observations and 81 attributes each.
