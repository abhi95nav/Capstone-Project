# Capstone-Project

Accurately determining house sale prices while considering crucial amenities and features
remains a continuous challenge in real estate. Traditional methods o9en need to pay more
a:en5on to the intricate interplay of property attributes, local factors, and market trends,
resulting in misguided decisions and discontent. This project aims to leverage the dataset from
the Kaggle compe55on to address this issue and develop a robust predictive model that accounts
for these variables, thereby enhancing the accuracy of house price predictions.
